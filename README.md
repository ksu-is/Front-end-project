# Front-end-project
A website that uses jQuery to connect to a Python/Flask micro web framework to interact with a MySQL database.
Latest version uses nginx web server to allow for file dowloads alongside Flask.

Use python as a front end for a mysql gradebook database. Billy Mitchell and Andrew Mitchell are working on this project. This project will link to our SQL database that we have to create for our Data Management class.
